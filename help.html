          <p class="p-legal">Welcome to the help page for <span class="name-highlight">Join</span>, your guide to using
            our kanban project management tool.
            Here, we’ll provide an overview of what <span class="name-highlight">Join</span> is, how it can benefit you,
            and how to use it.
          </p>

          <h2 class="h2-legal">What is Join?</h2>
          <p class="p-legal"><span class="name-highlight">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed
            and built by a group of dedicated
            students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p><br>
          <p class="p-legal">Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard," is a highly effective method to visualize
            work, limit
            work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="name-highlight">Join</span> leverages the
            principles of kanban
            to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p><br>
          <p class="p-legal">It is important to note that <span class="name-highlight">Join</span> is designed as an
            educational exercise and is not
            intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we
            cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding <span
              class="name-highlight">Join</span>.</p>

          <h2 class="h2-legal">How to use it</h2>
          <p class="p-legal">Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="name-highlight">Join</span>:</p>

          <h3 class="h3-legal">1<span class="spaced">. </span>Exploring the Board</h3>
          <p class="p-legal spaced-2">When you log in to <span class="name-highlight">Join</span>, you’ll find a default
            board.
            This board represents your project
            and contains four default lists: "To Do," "In Progress," "Await feedback," and "Done".</p>

          <h3 class="h3-legal">2<span class="spaced">. </span>Creating Contacts</h3>
          <p class="p-legal spaced-2">In <span class="name-highlight">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate
            on your
            projects. Go to the "Contacts"
            section, click on "New contact," and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be
            assigned tasks, and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>

          <h3 class="h3-legal">3<span class="spaced">. </span>Adding Cards</h3>
          <p class="p-legal spaced-2">Now that you’ve added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
            individual
            tasks. Click
            the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like
            task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>

          <h3 class="h3-legal">4<span class="spaced">. </span>Moving Cards</h3>
          <p class="p-legal spaced-2">As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by
            dragging
            and dropping the
            card from one list to another.</p>

          <h3 class="h3-legal">5<span class="spaced">. </span>Deleting Cards</h3>
          <p class="p-legal spaced-2">Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
            Deleting
            a card will
            permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
            irreversible.</p><br>

          <p class="p-legal">Remember that using <span class="name-highlight">Join</span> effectively requires
            consistent updates from you and your team to
            ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.</p><br>
